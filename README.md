This project uses PySpark to analyze 1 million synthetic retail sales transactions and generate key business insights. The pipeline performs data cleaning, feature engineering (revenue, month, weekday), and analytics to identify top revenue products, seasonal demand trends, and regional performance. This project showcases how PySpark can handle large-scale data efficiently while delivering insights that support business strategy, inventory planning, and revenue optimization.
